# nosql-challenge

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. The editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, want to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. This challenege uses PyMongo and is divided in to two parts:

Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
Part 2: Updating the Database

Part 1 can be found in the NoSQL-setup_starter.ipynb file and Part 2 can be found in the NoSQL_analysis_starter file.
